## Code Example (Illustrative - Adapt to your actual implementation)

```javascript
// Example of using the OpenAI API within the project
const { Configuration, OpenAIApi } = require("openai");
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

async function generateReadmeContent(prompt) {
  const response = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: "text-davinci-003", // Or a suitable model
    prompt: prompt,
    max_tokens: 500, // Adjust as needed
  });
  return response.data.choices[0].text;
}

// ... rest of your code ...
```
