# ðŸš€ First README Generated by project-readme-gen



This project, `project-readme-gen`, is a command-line tool (CLI) for generating README files. It leverages both Google's Generative AI (`@google/generative-ai`) and OpenAI's API (`openai`) to create the content.  It uses `commander` for handling command-line arguments, `dotenv` for managing environment variables (likely for API keys), `fs-extra` for file system operations, and `glob` for file pattern matching (possibly to analyze project structure for README generation).  Version 1.0.0 is the current release.

This JavaScript code snippet initializes a connection to Google's Gemini API using the `gemini-1.5-pro` model. It requires the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set. The core functionality lies within the `analyzeProject` function, which takes a `projectPath` as input. While the complete implementation of `analyzeProject` is not shown, the code sets up the foundation for processing files within the given project path, likely using `fs-extra` for file system operations, `path` for path manipulation, and `glob` for file pattern matching.  This suggests that the code is intended to perform some kind of analysis on a given project, potentially using the Gemini model for natural language processing or code understanding tasks based on the project's files.


This script uses Commander.js to create a command-line interface (CLI) for generating a README file.  It takes the project directory path as an argument and calls the `generateReadme` function from the main application (./index.js).  If any errors occur during README generation, it prints an error message to the console.
